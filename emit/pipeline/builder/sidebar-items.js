When `drop()`ped, the background collector (if any) will be flushed and shut down."],["PipelineBuilder","`PipelineBuilder` creates an event emitting pipeline. Calling `init()` will install the pipeline globally for use by the `emit!()` family of macros. Calling `detach()` will return an independent pipeline that can be used in isolation."]]});
